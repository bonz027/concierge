#Project Title
Concierge - A better way to travel. 

##Description
Concierge was created for those looking to travel to a new city and don't want to spend hours looking up where to go, and what to do in a new city. You let us know what city you are traveling to, what you would like to see, and we pair you with the perfect City Enhancer that will show you around for a flat rate. No need to waste time searching for what to do. Our City Enhancers are locals, and know their city like the back of their hands. You worry about traveling safely and let us plan your day. 

##Getting Started
